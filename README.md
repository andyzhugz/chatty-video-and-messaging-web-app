## Instructions:
 
Hw3  is your first group homework. 
The Agile methodology promotes self-organized and motivated teams.
One key element in maintaining the efficiency of a team is the **team agreement**.

Go over the resources listed below and create your team agreement.

There is no required document length, but your agreement should address  the 
main points highlighted in the articles.

## Submission:
- Your team agreement should be included in the wiki of your GitHub repo.
- Only one submission per team.
- Individual submissions will not be accepted.

## Evaluation:
- This assignment does not have a grading rubric.
- You will be assigned a TA, and you should meet (or communicate via email) with your TA before the due date.
- Give enough time to the TA to review your submission before the meeting.
- The TA will give you feedback during the meeting, and you should address any concerns raised by them before the final submission.
- We recommend that you send any updates to your TA before the final submission to ensure that you pass the assignment. 
- The TA should tell you if your submission is passable (pass) or not before the final submission, assuming you gave them enough time to review your work.
